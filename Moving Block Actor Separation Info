This glitch can be used to create 'infinite blocks' which reappear instantly when destroyed which can be used to create tnt dupers and block generators
 - When performed on a tile entity the block does not become infinite but instead loses all of its tile entity data, in some cases causing a crash if interacted with (example: auto crafter)
 - When the chunk containing the separated moving block actor is unloaded it reverts to a normal block
 - This glitch only works with blocks movable by pistons for survival purposes

Illegal items discovered so far from this glitch:
 - using a cauldron with different liquids can allow you to get many different illegals
    - using bottles on the moving cauldron actor can allow you to get invalid data value potions ranging from data values 47-32767
       - these potions will appear to be water bottles however they will not display the 'no effects' text in the tooltip when held in the hotbar
    - these in turn can be used to brew invalid data value splash potions ranging from data values 47-32767
       - these potions will be named 'no effects'
    - [TEST] again, these can be used to brew invalid data value lingering potions which can the be used to craft invalid data value tipped arrows
       - [TEST] many of these have been found to crash the game instantly upon being processed
    - using arrows on the moving cauldron actor can allow you to get invalid data value arrows ranging from data values 48-32767 and arrows of water (data value 1)
 - using a cauldron with dye in it can allow you to get illegally dyed leather armour, leather horse armour and wolf armour
    - almost anything you dye in this moving cauldron actor will have an illegal dye colour due to there being millions of different dye values
